## Introduction
This is a general similarity-based unsupervised deep denoising approach to suppress not only independent but also correlated image noise.
Theoretical analysis proves the equivalent effectiveness of this unsupervised approach to the supervised counterpart.
This project shows several application cases, including denoising natural, microscopic, low-dose CT and photon-counting micro-CT images.
This general approach can be applied to many other fields by constructing the similar training samples based on the domain-specific prior.


## Installation
Assuming [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) with python 3.6, the required packages for this project can be installed as:
```shell script
conda install pytorch==1.4.0 torchvision==0.5.0 cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch
conda install faiss-gpu cudatoolkit=10.0 -c pytorch
conda install matplotlib
conda install -c conda-forge python-lmdb tqdm imageio addict tensorboard opencv
```
Then, clone this repo
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/niuchuangnn/noise2sim.git
cd noise2sim
```

## Applications

### Natural Images

Download BSD68 test dataset at [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b_RvBwIr9yLg8yPWb0BHYmWiOEVUvG4K?usp=sharing),
and put them under the folder  ```./datasets/```

Prepare dataset:
```shell script
python ./tools/prepare_bsd400_lmdb.py
```

Run on 1 GPU:
```shell script
python ./tools/train_dist.py --config-file ./configs/bsd400_unet2_ps3_ns8_gpu1.py
```
Run on 8 GPUs:
```shell script
python ./tools/train_dist.py --config-file ./configs/bsd400_unet2_ps3_ns8_gpu8.py
```
The results in paper were obtained using 8 GPUs, you can obtain similar results with 1 GPU.

### Low-dose CT Images
The low-dose CT dataset can be obtained at [Low Dose CT Grand Challenge](https://www.aapm.org/grandchallenge/lowdosect/).

### Spectral CT Images
The photon-counting spectral micro-CT data can be obtained [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UaS6YdPZ_M0opxpIaUXjbydNq1IlVDiG/view?usp=sharing).

### Microscopy Images
The microscopy image can be obtained [here](http://data.celltrackingchallenge.net/training-datasets/Fluo-N2DH-GOWT1.zip).
